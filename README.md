# fitbit_steps_and_whatpulse_keypresses_comparison

This project shows how to extract 30-day Fitbit steps files into a single .json file and produce a daily steps table. It also shows how to extract Whatpulse keypress data into a separate .csv file. Finally, it shows how to perform a regression analysis using this step and keypress data. More documentation will be provided in the future.
